Patch Title:	Fix bug in breadth_first_search implementation

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
> **Note:** This message was automatically generated by PAUL. Please review the proposed changes carefully before merging.

This PR addresses a bug in the breadth_first_search function which could lead to an infinite loop when the queue is exhausted. The function has been modified to ensure it checks if the queue is empty before dequeuing, and it updates nodesseen only with new nodes. All related tests now pass.
