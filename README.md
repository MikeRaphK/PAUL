# PAUL â€“ Patch Automation Using LLMs

**PAUL** (Patch Automation Using LLMs) is a developer tool that leverages Large Language Models to automatically address GitHub issues by reading, understanding, and patching codebases. With a single command, PAUL clones a GitHub repository, analyzes a given issue, and generates a targeted code fix, complete with a commit message and pull request.

## Overview
PAUL stands for Patch Automation Using LLMs. It simplifies the process of code maintenance and issue resolution for developers by automating the patching process of software projects via intelligent parsing of GitHub issues.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MikeRaphK/PAUL.git
   cd PAUL
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file and add your credentials:
   ```bash
   GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Build and run the Docker container locally:
   ```bash
   docker build -t paul .
   docker run -it -e GITHUB_TOKEN=${GITHUB_TOKEN} -e OPENAI_API_KEY=${OPENAI_API_KEY} paul
   ```

## GitHub Actions Integration

To use PAUL as a GitHub action in another repository, include the following workflow configuration as `.github/workflows/run-paul.yml`:
```yml
name: Run PAUL

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      issue_number:
        description: "Issue Number"
        required: true
  issues:
    types: [opened, reopened]

jobs:
  run-paul:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run PAUL
        uses: MikeRaphK/PAUL@main
        with:
          repo_url: https://github.com/${{ github.repository }}
          issue_number: ${{ github.event.issue.number || github.event.inputs.issue_number }}
          openai-api-key: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
          github-token: ${{ secrets.PAUL_GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

## Required Environment Variables

When using PAUL, you need to set the following environment variables in your system or GitHub Secrets:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your API key for accessing OpenAI's services. You can obtain this key from your OpenAI account.
- `PAUL_GITHUB_TOKEN`: This should be a fine-grained Personal Access Token (PAT) with read/write permissions for contents and pull requests. You can create it in your GitHub account settings.

To add these as GitHub Secrets, navigate to your repository on GitHub, go to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions > New repository secret.

## Usage
```bash
python main.py <GitHub Repository URL> <Issue Number>
```

Example:
```bash
python main.py https://github.com/yourusername/myproject 17
```
