Patch Title:	Fix bug in longest common subsequence calculation

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
> **Note:** This message was automatically generated by PAUL. Please review the proposed changes carefully.

This patch resolves a bug in the `longest_common_subsequence` function found in `python_programs/longest_common_subsequence.py`. The previous implementation failed to correctly compute the longest common subsequence due to incorrect handling of the recursive calls when characters matched. The function was updated to ensure it correctly concatenates the matching character and recursively calls itself on the substrings that follow. This fix is essential for passing all existing tests in `python_testcases/test_longest_common_subsequence.py`, thereby ensuring correctness and reliability in subsequence calculations.

- `read_file` with arguments `{"file_path":"python_programs/longest_common_subsequence.py"}`
- `write_file` with arguments `{"file_path":"python_programs/longest_common_subsequence.py","text":"def longest_common_subsequence(a, b):\n    if not a or not b:\n        return ''\n\n    elif a[0] == b[0]:\n        return a[0] + longest_common_subsequence(a[1:], b[1:])  # Corrected to check both subsequences\n\n    else:\n        return max(\n            longest_common_subsequence(a, b[1:]),\n            longest_common_subsequence(a[1:], b),\n            key=len\n        )\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\nLongest Common Subsequence\n\n\nCalculates the longest subsequence common to the two input strings.
