Patch Title:	Fix k-heapsort function to yield correctly

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
> **Note:** This message was automatically generated by PAUL. Please review the proposed changes carefully.

This patch corrects the element yielding mechanism in the `kheapsort` function within the `kheapsort.py` file. Previously, the function incorrectly handled the yielding of elements, leading to duplicates and incorrect ordering when processing the heap.

The issue stemmed from the management of the heap when inserting new elements and popping the smallest element. This update ensures that elements are yielded properly from the heap only when they are popped, allowing for the correct sorted order of results.

The function still adheres to the original constraints, ensuring it efficiently sorts an almost-sorted array where each element is at most `k` places away from its sorted position.

- `read_file` with arguments `{"file_path":"python_testcases/test_kheapsort.py"}`
