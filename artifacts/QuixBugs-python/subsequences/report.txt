Patch Title:    Correct subsequences function logic in subsequences.py

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
> **Note:** This message was automatically generated by PAUL. Please review the proposed changes carefully.

This patch addresses a bug in the `subsequences` function within `subsequences.py`. The original implementation failed to generate correct ascending subsequences of a given length k between two limits, a and b. 

The fix modifies the recursion logic to properly generate and extend subsequences by ensuring valid combinations are formed within the correct range. Specifically, an adjustment was made to ensure the loop iterates over the correct starting points and that recursive calls correctly construct the combinations. This approach now returns accurate results when calculating all ascending subsequences.

All tests associated with `test_subsequences.py` now pass, confirming that the function's logic has been corrected and works as expected.
